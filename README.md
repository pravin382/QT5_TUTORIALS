This tutorials series is taken from [QT5 tutorial](https://zetcode.com/gui/qt5/) to learn QT5. The main motive being to make cooler computer vision tools for later. I tend to think that I am planting a tree :smile:


## Requirements
   - QT5

This tutorial will be using C++14.

The installed version of QT can be checked using 
```qmake --version```. In my case I get following output:
``` 
$ qmake --version
QMake version 3.1
Using Qt version 5.9.5 in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
```
